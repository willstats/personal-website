# willzahary.com â€” Personal Website v1.0
This is my **first** personal website. After I began looking into web development, I thought a personal website would be a great first project. I built this website from scratch using mostly my own HTML and CSS; the only things I copied from elsewhere are the down arrow animation found [here](https://codepen.io/raf187/pen/BvgGRQ), and the changing text effect on the landing page found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17254442/how-to-fade-in-out-multiple-texts-using-css-jquery-like-on-droplr).

## Some Basic Information
This website took me about a week and a half to make, working on it infrequently and casually during this time period. Considering it's my first website and required a lot of new learning during the process, I am quite happy with how it turned out, and I expect all future websites of mine to take much less time to finish.

## What's Next
The website is very bare-bones right now. In the near future, I would like to add a blog page and perhaps an art page showcasing my graphic design and photography. 

On top of this, I would like to add a toggle button for the dark mode that I currently have in place. Currently, dark mode is completely automatic based on the user's device settings, but I would like to give more choice for those who may prefer the color theme opposite to their device settings.

## Closing
Let me know if you have any questions! You can reach me at williamzahary@gmail.com. Hope you enjoy the website!
